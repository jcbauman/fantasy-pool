      "We are running this entirely on the honor code, so please put accurate stats in.  It would be nice if there were third party observers like the WNBA writing down everything we do, but we only have ourselves.  Additionally, if we all keep tracking game location and dates accurately, it will allow me to add more features in the future based on this data.",

    title: "How does doubles scoring work?",
    content:
      "When you're tracking doubles games, a team's overall win or loss (whether by 8-ball or scratch) should apply to every member of the team.  Personal shots like potting runs of balls, scratching, skill shots, etc. are applied on a per-player basis.",

  {
    title: "How do skill shots work?",
    content:
      "Skill shots are made shots that either include bank shots (off the wall), combos (2 or more non-cue balls hitting each other), and caroms (ball glancing off another). Skill shots can only be counted for succesful called shots, not incidentals and slops -  i.e. if you did not clearly mean to do it, it doesn't count. Skill shots only apply to the shooting player and not to every member of a doubles team.",

    title: "How do scratches work?",
    content:
      "Scratches in fantasy pool involve the cue ball going into the pocket. Table scratches need not count to the scratches stat unless you and any partner/opponent agree to include them beforehand.  Don't count scratches that result in the end of a game for this stat, those count towards the Loss by 8-ball scratch stat. Scratches only apply to the shooting player and not to every member of a doubles team.",

    title: "How do runs work?",
    content:
      "Runs count when you pocket 3 or more balls in a row before missing. Enter your total number of balls pocketed in-a-row after your run is finished.  Runs only apply to the shooting player and not to every member of a doubles team. If you are playing scotch doubles, count any personal run and your partner's run seperately - don't add them together for both players.",

      "If you have any cool stat ideas I will add them. Don't want to be overly confusing.  Any stats that you have previously tracked in these areas are still there, they just aren't counting towards Fantasy points at the moment.",
